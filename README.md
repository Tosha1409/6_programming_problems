6 Programming problems from Medium.com article (https://medium.com/better-programming/do-you-know-how-to-solve-these-programming-problems-18d04defc05e).

1.py - **Plus Minus**
2.py - **Two Sum**
3.py - **Largest palindrome product**
4.py - **Distinct powers**
*Actually this one ended to be hardest task from all. I didnt used brute force like in article or like most of people would do. I've made assuption that **a** and **b** lowest limit is 2 and this is not mentioned in task. Though brute force solution in article also making assumption that **a** and **b** have same limits. But, anyway with slight modification of code it can be changed.*
5.py - **Kaprekars Constant**
6.py - **Swap Nodes in Pairs**
*Python is not the best language for nodes task, but i've done it anyway.*
